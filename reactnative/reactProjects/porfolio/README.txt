guide:
make server folder with express in it 
make client folder and make react app 
both have to npm start separatly 
now -> we can handle request at server ,we have to make request to get response from server 
ie we use fetch().then.catch or say promise ,to fetch data .

server will provide data in json format we use it and we have to  render it in react 
in case of get response (we want some data when we load ) we use useEffect and get the required data in initializing params

to post a form we have to use bodyparser in server .
on react we use useState params/variable .
